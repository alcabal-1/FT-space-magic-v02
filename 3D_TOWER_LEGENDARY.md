## 🎬 DEMO SCRIPT FOR PRESENTATIONS

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
*"This is Frontier Tower's digital twin. What you're seeing isn't just visualization—it's living intelligence. Each floor represents real architectural space, and those glowing spheres? That's actual community activity happening right now."*

### **The Magic Moment (60 seconds)**
*"Watch this..."* [Click on a floor]  
*"The camera smoothly focuses on Floor 8, while other floors fade to a ghosted state. This isn't just pretty animation—this is professional spatial intelligence. The bubbles you see are sized by attendance, colored by event type, and pulsing with real-time energy."*

### **Technical Excellence (30 seconds)**
*"Under the hood: TypeScript, Three.js, React Fiber, and Zustand. 60fps WebGL performance. Real API integration. This runs in any modern browser, but it's built like enterprise software."*

### **The Future Vision (30 seconds)**
*"This is just the beginning. Imagine adding AR overlays, VR walkthroughs, AI-powered space optimization. This architecture scales from a single building to an entire smart city."*
